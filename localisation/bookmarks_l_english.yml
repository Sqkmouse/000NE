 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 NEE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the defeat of the workers elsewhere in the United States, the large amounts of weapons factories and ports allowed New England to become a stronghold for the workers' militae, even holding their own against the private military companies that seized the South."
 GCE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The New England Republic is an orphan. Hideously unpopular with the workers, it has been on the brink of collapse since the oligarchs seized it from the militae."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nIt was this Great Depression which accelerated the uprisings around the nation that were put down in all but in the New English mountains."
 NYC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Worker's War, the US entered into treaties with states it could not control effectively. New autonomy underneath the US was granted to New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. As the United States crumbles, more states are granted these autonomies. However, these autonomies are not for the people, but as a last ditch effort to attempt to further deregulate the economy and climb out of the depression."
 FOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Militae aimed to hang Ford, but with his own private army, that proved difficult. After Ford's forces beat back the revolution, he then seized the opportunity to take control of Michigan. After a few massive advertising campaigns, Ford ascended the position of State-Controller of Michigan without too much difficulty. Of course, Detroit is a massive industrial city, and many industrial workers aren't quite fond of Fordism and his exploiting them."
 OHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the confusion of the Worker's War, The House of Marx rose to power in Ohio. Dwain I, Emperor of Ohio, has made it clear that he believes Ohio was slighted in the Toldeo War, and that war with Michigan is a necesity if a peaceful accord cannot be reached."
