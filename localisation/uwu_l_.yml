Tomáš Masaryk stated that the corridor would correct "The division of the Czechoslovaks and Yugoslavs" arising from the 9th century Hungarian invasion.
This would free the Croatian Slavs, a minority in Burgenland, from the Austro-Hungarian yoke, and bring greater control of the Danube to Czechoslovakia and her allies."
