Austria_the1936civilwar_desc:0 "Our revolts in '27 and '34 were nearly successful. If the Social Democrats had not been able to rally the armed forces against us, we surely would have won. The loss of Schussnig and Dolfuss is haunting, but the now galvanized Catholic forces more than make up for it. It's time for a New Austria."
Austria_asocialistfuture:0 "A Socialist Future"
Austria_asocialistfuture_desc:0 "Cooperating with the Social Democrats against the Fascists was justified, of course. But they are still liberals. They and their bourgeois parliament have no place in Austria. We cannot lay hold to the ready-made state machinery, but we can destroy it."

Austria_buildingaustria_desc:0 "If we are to restore the glory of our nation, however we chose to, we will need a strong industrial backbone."
Austria_anaustrofascistfuture:0 "An Austrofascist Future"
Austria_anaustrofascistfuture_desc:0 "We don't want to join the protestant filth in Germany. We are Catholics. His Holiness has decreed that we must pursue a Corporate mode of production, that the classes must collaborate. Thy will be done."
Austria_fourfutures:0 "Four Futures"
Austria_fourfutures_desc:0 "After the partition our once massive empire was reduced to a tiny republic. Many paramilitary forces had been formed during the early 1920's alongside political strife between the left and right. The July Revolt of '27, the Civil War of '34. Our democracy has been threatened not by the great powers, but by our own people. What will become of our great nation?"

Austria_theaustriansecondrepublic_desc:0 "The First Republic has been tumultuous, but that does not mean that we should abandon democracy. The right threatens us, yes, but that does not mean we should bend a knee to them."
Austria_asocialdemocraticfuture:0 "A Social Democratic Future"
Austria_asocialdemocraticfuture_desc:0 "The industrialists are beginning to understand, it's not a question of left versus right anymore. It's a question of us, or the KPO. If we can garner their support, we may be able to secure our victory in the next election, and our Austria."
Austria_areturntoourpast:0 "A Return to Our Past"
Austria_areturntoourpast_desc:0 "Until a Hapsburg is back on the Austrian throne, no, the Austro-Hungarian throne: Chaos will reign in Danubia. Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser!"
