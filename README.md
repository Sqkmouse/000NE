# War on Destiny
is a modification for Hearts of Iron IV that imagines an alternate history where Herbert Hoover fell slightly differently when he was pushed to the ground by another child during his attendance at school. His spine hit a rock just right and he developed a permanent limp. Hoover walks around 50% more slowly than in the original timeline (OTL).
